# WeatherPy_Challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of WeatherPy is to create an app to retrieve and analyze weather data for a travel company called PlanMyTrip. We will be providing weather data for customers, a weather description to the weather data, we use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From a list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
